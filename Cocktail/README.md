# Cocktails

Cocktails aims to serve anyone anywhere who has a need to look for cocktail recipes and grants them convinient access to it. Users could be professional bartenders who could now do away with physical notes all the way till people at house parties who wish to make their own cocktails. Normal users would be able to search for cocktails while paid users will be able to create their own favourites list!

This repository is for the frontend. You may find the backend repository [HERE](https://github.com/WeiLong006/Project_4_backend).

## User Stories

Users should be able to:

1. Login with their email and password
2. Search using names or part of the names of cocktails
3. Access the recipe
4. Paid users are able to create a favourites list tag to their personal email.

## General Approach

1. Started out by drawing out the hierarchy of the site
2. Worked on the schema and started seeding the data
3. Used postman to test the endpoints until all endpoints were successful
4. Started with login page followed by the paid user page
5. Once the paid user age and functions were completed, started on the normal user page.
6. Worked on base CSS styling for background and buttons using tailwind.
7. Explored further CSS styling

## Limitations & Future work

- Touch up the styling
- Seed more data into the cocktail database
- Creating authenticated pages for admin users to maintain the site (eg. adding new cocktails or managing users)
- Research on how to upload pictures into the database
